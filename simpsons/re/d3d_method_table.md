# The game's D3D command-writer method table

Extracted from live guest memory (image data at `0x821F4274`, read passively
from the running game). This is the game's dispatch table mapping D3D-level
rendering operations to the handler functions that encode them as PM4 GPU
command packets -- i.e. **the complete API boundary between "the game decides
what to draw" and "GPU command buffer bytes."** Every draw, state change,
texture bind, resolve and swap the game ever performs goes through exactly one
of these 73 handlers. All 73 are verified present in the recompiled function
table (nothing the renderer calls was missed by analysis).

The `pm4 ops` column lists PM4 type-3 opcodes whose opcode-byte immediates
appear in the handler body (conservative static extraction -- absence means
the header is composed dynamically, not that the handler does nothing; the
many unlabeled short handlers are almost certainly SET_CONSTANT-style state
writers whose packet headers come from the shared ring-writer using the
`meta` word). `meta` is the table's per-entry descriptor (0x4000XXYY; XX
correlates with ring space needed, YY with an argument/type field).

**Draw inventory (the batching/native-renderer hook set):** entries 17, 18,
33, 38, 39 and 45 are the six in-table draw emitters; additionally
`sub_82455570`, `sub_82444A48`, `sub_82444A80` (outside this table) contain
draw-packet encodings -- the latter two belong to a separate submission path
(UI/video layer suspect). Entry 45 pairs its draw with VIZ_QUERY/COND_EXEC:
the predicated (occlusion-tested) draw path.
